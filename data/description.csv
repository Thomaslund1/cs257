"This game is from an odd genre, real-time card games.  Each of the players (except the dealer) is a person falling to his death.  The goal is not to live, rather just to be the last one to go splat.  The dealer continues dealing cards to players, eventually giving them &apos;ground&apos; cards.  But on the way down players can do all kinds of nasty stuff to each other to ensure their relative longevity.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;",71

"Players take on the role of editors in this older German title, choosing stories of various general types (politics, sports, entertainment, etc.) to run in their respective newspapers.  Two factors determine a story&apos;s worth: timing and size.  The timing is relevant because the later in the game the story is run the more points it&apos;s potentially worth.

Playing Victims, Suspects, Scenes, and Evidence-melds, players try to build a case against various suspects for the famous Jack the Ripper serial murders.  Whichever suit has the most cards played in it when a player goes out is the guilty party, but if all the Victim cards come out before the end of the game, the Ripper might escape, giving the player who produced that card a significant point allowance.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Thi...",99
"This small-publisher game comes with loads of wooden hex-shaped tiles, a hex board, and three pawns.  The object of the game is to move your pawn from one corner of the hex board to the opposite corner.  However, instead of taking your move, you can place a hex tile on the board.

Inside the package are cards for properties on Manhattan island, workers, building materials, and building contracts.  Each turn, players turn over a card and either purchase it outright or auction it to the group.  But when the contracts get bought, players will need to negotiate a deal, because it&apos;s very difficult to build a decent sized building on your own.  The deal making is vicious and cutthroat,...",107

Five different artists have produced a bunch of paintings, and it&apos;s the player&apos;s task to be both the buyer and the seller, hopefully making a profit in both roles.

"In an interesting departure from his normally computational-heavy game structure, Reiner Knizia put together this negotiation game.  Players are represented on the board by a group of politicians moving through a network of committees, and need to seek support from their competitors to advance upward toward the Senate.

"The world of horseracing has long been associated with cheating in all its forms.  But few games ever attempt to simulate that aspect.  Players are assigned a horse and must move it around the track by rolling a single die.  This would be rather boring if the game didn&apos;t allow for the players to bet on another player&apos;s horse, so the dilemma is whether or not to move your horse badly just to make it easier for the horse you bet on to win.

The value of each building is determined by the type of buildings in the same block, so both a school and an apartment building receive bonuses for existing to...",135
"Another of Reiner Knizia's fleet of games, this one is about making profits by buying and selling business stock. Players use cards to manipulate the price of three types of stocks (oil, technology, and retail), and the buying and selling of the stocks is pretty severely limited. Short and sweet, this game is both elegant and abstract.  In a change from the original version, the three stocks have different levels of volatility.  Technology is the most volatile, oil is the least volatile but with higher divi...",136

"The setting is northern Mexico starting in 1898 where an economic boom, a dictator who welcomes foreign investment and wide-open land set the stage for one of the greatest capitalist free-for-alls in history. Each player is an hacendado. These entrepreneurs vie to build the largest empire of railroads, mines, ranches and other businesses.

"Very nice combination of tile placement and betting. Players lay long tiles to build 5 towers taller and taller, whilst betting on which will be the tallest to shortest. The trick is that when you lay a tile to raise a tower one, two or three stories tall, this controls how much you can bet (1,2 or 3 tokens) and crucially, which draw pile you take from (pile 1, 2 or 3). Since the draw piles are face-up, I might want to draw from pile 3 to get a tile which will boost a tower I&apos;ve bet on, but that means ...",271

If you take a trick, you advance your scoring token, however each scoring space can only be occupied by one person, jumping the piece&lt;samp&gt; immediately ahead of you. In addition, there are certain spaces which allow that player to set one of the suits as trump. Eventually all the suits are established as some form of trump, however each of them is ranked top to bottom. Once one of the...",317

"In Das letzte Paradies, the players purchase building sites through secret bids, and either build villas or hotels there, or leave the land undeveloped. Buildings are lucrative only if the immediate surrounding area is preserved. The value of nature is appreciated so much more if it is in danger of disappearing. Correspondingly, the price of virgin land varies widely - either very high, or very low - because preservation of nature does not give you income, but it does get you more recognition for your troub...",320

Next, you roll the dice, which show 1-2-3-4-7-X on one dice and 1-2-3-5-6-X on the other. After your first roll, if you roll doubles, move your pawn 1, 2, or 3 spaces...",322
"Bucket Brigade is a card game with a racing track by Reiner Knizia. Players use colored cards (numbered 1 or 2) to move four colored tokens along a track. The color that wins the race makes cards in that color worth +3 at the end of the round.  The other three, depending on how far they advanced, are worth anywhere from +2 to -1.  If a color moved farther, its color are worth more points -- but you probably spent more of that color to move it there, giving you fewer points!  Irony.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The ...",323

It is a cunningly designed race to the finish in which your fuel (carrots) must practically run out (all but 10 carrots or fewer) at the moment you hit the finish line.  You also have three lettuce cards you must spend during the course of the race.  The farther you move, the more carrots you spend, and there are a variety of ways to gai...",325

"In this fluffy, dice-intensive game set in Pamplona, Spain, players control 3-runner teams competing in the running of the bulls.  By rolling the dice and moving their runners (the most significant decisions are which runners to move, and how far to move them when a choice is available), the players try to keep their teams in front of and as close to the bull as possible, while pushing other runners into more cowardly locations.  The reason for all this is that after all players have had their turns, there&...",330
"from the Game Report:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;The game is played in a series of rounds during which each person plays a card to the center of the table. Usually these cards will fall into one of four Suits: Gold, Courtiers, Provinces and Musketeers. The cards feature ranks from 1-7, and after all cards have been played the person who played the highest card in each Suit collects all the cards of that type. Captured cards are then placed into a person&apos;s &quot;structure&quot;, which shows all the elements o...",331

The highest card played will take the blue sticks and the lowest card will take the red sticks.  The trick is that a red stick cancels a blue stick (that is, a well balanced tightrope walker), and the goal is to score as few points as possible.  However, there are two different ways of playing the game, depending on how players wish to play: stra...",332
