"MedFront details the conflict between the Allies and Germany during WWII from 1940-43, as well as the Spanish Civil War from 1936-39. Players have to contend with production, supply, command control and the weather to break the other side&apos;s lines and achieve victory.  The game comes with a fantastic detailed map of Spain and North Africa printed on card and many wooden blocks for the units. This is just one portion of the complete EuroFront series, which covers the entire European conflict of WWII.&lt;...",26
