"In this fantasy relative to Twilight Imperium, players control races that must juggle military and economic concerns with a quest to gather the magical stars spread across the land.  The game board is made up of hex tiles and players use a resource system that has similarities to The Settlers of Catan.  A card driven system resolves players&apos; quests.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Expanded by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;    Battlemist: The Sails of War&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Reimplemented by:&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/...",31
