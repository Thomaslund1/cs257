"On the hunt for petrified treasures, players are competing paleontologists trying to make as complete a set as possible of several fossils.  The board is laid out with a random bunch of fossil pieces and players have to take turns moving a stone about the field to a location where they want to pick up a fossil piece.  However, every movement costs them prestige points so they have to weigh carefully if the fossil is worth the effort.&lt;br/&gt;&lt;br/&gt;Won Games Magazine Game of the Year award in 1999.&lt...",30
